            <h2>What is creator protection?</h2>
            <p>Creator Protection is a spam filter designed to block harmful messages and comments in streams and videos. During a stream, CP will scan messages being sent in the chat, looking for anything offensive, inappropriate, violent, or slanderous, while also allowing regular, harmless messages to stay. Creator Protection will enable creators to have control over what is being said in their stream, creating a less toxic and more family-friendly environment.</p>

            <h2>Why choose creator protection?</h2>
            <p>Content creation has become a profession for many people in today’s world. Creators rely on the content to make a living, which is why we strive to make it the best possible for creators.  All streamers read their chat and comments, as it is commonly thought that the more you interact with your viewers, the higher your retention rate will be. When streamers read chat and receive hate comments, it makes it more challenging to do their jobs and makes them feel worse about themselves. Spending so much of your time streaming, it is critical to filter out these “hate comments”, as receiving them constantly will take a toll on you. So, by buying Creator Protection, you will be able to do your job without dealing with negative messages. </p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>Creator Protection works in the application layer to intercept messages before they can reach the creator.  In the application layer, the data is being adjusted and prepared to present to a user, or in this case, the message to be delivered. So the spam filter in the application layer would scan the data, and then decide whether or not it is harmful and if the message should be blocked. </p>
